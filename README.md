The genetic admixture of the Ashkenazi Jews is remarkably consistent worldwide. The primary genetic influences are from Anatolian Neolithic Farmers and Indo-Europeans. Additionally, Zagros Neolithic Farmers and Levantine components are notable, with a small percentage of Caucasus Hunter Gatherers also evident.
In scenarios where Ashkenazi Jews remained longer in Central Asia, the contributions from Zagros Neolithic Farmers became more pronounced, while the Indo-European components decreased. Conversely, a migration further east resulted in an increase in Siberian Hunter Gatherer components.
Research indicates at least two major waves of admixture in Uyghur genetics. The first wave involved Indo-European admixture with local groups, followed by a second wave involving Turkic (Siberian Hunter Gatherer) admixture.
